# Extraction of fa√ßade details from street-view panoramic images
This is a modified implementation of Mask R-CNN on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone.
Instance segmenting more than 2 classes in an image,where image dataset is from publicly available data, for annotation we are using VGG annotator latest version

Here we defined 5 classes :
 - Window
 - Wall
 - Basement_window
 - Door
 - Balcony
 
The repository includes:
- Source code of Mask R-CNN built on FPN and ResNet101.
- Pre-trained weights for MS COCO
- Jupyter notebooks to visualize the detection pipeline at every step
- ParallelModel class for multi-GPU training
- Evaluation on MS COCO metrics (AP)
- Example of training on your own dataset
